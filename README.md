# Note App

The technologies used in this program was Javascript, node and http-server.
This was the week 7 pair programming challenge for [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com) redone alone for clarity.

### Brief

The challenge for this week was to build a single page front end web application for taking notes.
This also including building a testing framework from scratch.

### User stories

```
As I user,
So I can see what notes I have made,
I would like to see the first 20 characters on each note

As a user,
So that I can see my notes,
I would like the the whole contents when I click on each link on its own page

As a user,
So that I can record something,
I can create a new note on the page and see it being displayed

```

### How to use

Steps for use:

1. Clone this repo
2. run `npm install`
3. run node node_modules/http-server/bin/http-server -c-1
4. Go to localhost:8080

## How to run the tests

1. Open specRunner.html in chrome
2. Open the chrome-devtools console (cmd + alt + j on a mac, ctrl + shift j on windows)
3. If a test passed, 'Test Passed' will output to the console
